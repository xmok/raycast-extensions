# 40 Questions

Questions to ask yourself at the end of each year.

This small Raycast extension surfaces a curated set of 40 reflective questions intended for an end-of-year review. It provides two commands (see `package.json`):

- **Answer 40 Questions** — shows a form-like interface to submit answers.
- **Browse 40 Questions** — lists questions for quick reading and copying.

## Configuration

All available languages from the original repository are supported. If you want to use your own set of questions, just create a fork of the [40-questions](https://github.com/kepano/40-questions/fork) repository and set the "Questions Repo" preference to point to your fork.
