# Word Count

Count the number of characters, words, sentences, and paragraphs in some text.

## Tips

- The command will automatically count any text in your clipboard. To clear, use `⌘ + E`.
- Whitespace is ignored by default when counting characters. To toggle whitespace counting, use `⌘ + T`.

### Count from Screenshot (macOS only)

Capture any text on screen and get instant character, word, sentence, and paragraph counts using OCR.

**Requirements:** This feature uses [Raycast Cross-Extension](https://github.com/LitoMore/raycast-cross-extension-conventions) and requires the [ScreenOCR](https://www.raycast.com/huzef44/screenocr) extension to be installed on your Mac. When you run this command, it will launch ScreenOCR to capture the text and return the results back to Word Count.

- Press `Esc` to cancel screenshot capture
- Works best with clear, high-contrast text
