# SVG Studio

**The missing bridge between AI-generated code and visual assets.**

**SVG Studio** transforms Raycast into a lightweight IDE for vector graphics. It is designed for developers, designers, and specifically for **AI-assisted workflows**.

Whether you need to preview an icon generated by Gemini/ChatGPT, tweak a color attribute, or export a high-resolution PNG for a presentation, SVG Studio handles it all with a native-like experience.

## 🤖 The Perfect Companion for AI Coding

AI models like **Gemini**, **ChatGPT**, and **Claude** are amazing at writing SVG code, but they often leave you staring at raw text blocks without a preview.

**SVG Studio solves this pain point:**

1. **Copy**: Grab the raw SVG code block from your AI conversation.
2. **Launch**: Open SVG Studio via Raycast.
3. **Visualize**: The image renders instantly from your clipboard.
4. **Export**: Save it as a high-quality PNG asset immediately.

No more pasting code into online converters or saving `.svg` files just to see what they look like.

## ✨ Key Features

- **⚡️ Instant Preview**: Automatically detects and renders SVG code from your clipboard on startup.
- **🖼 High-Res Export**: Export SVGs to PNG with **1x, 2x (Retina), or 4x scaling**. Perfect for slides and web assets.
- **📝 Pro Code Editor**: Integrated **Ace Editor** provides syntax highlighting, code folding, and auto-completion.
- **🎨 Interactive Canvas**:
  - **Pan**: Hold `Space` and drag to move the canvas.
  - **Zoom**: Use mouse wheel or on-screen controls to inspect details.
  - **Auto Fit**: One-click to center and fit the image to the window.
- **🌑 Dark Mode Support**: The editor and canvas automatically adapt to your system's theme.
- **📋 Smart Copy**: One-click to copy the rendered PNG image directly to your clipboard.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Copy**: Copy any SVG code (from an AI chat, a repo, or a file).
2. **Open**: Run the "Open SVG Studio" command in Raycast.
3. **Edit & Inspect**:
   - Modify code on the left to see real-time updates.
   - Use `Space + Drag` to pan and `Scroll` to zoom.
4. **Export**: Choose your scale (e.g., `@2x`) and click "Save PNG" or "Copy Image".

## 🛠 Technical Details
