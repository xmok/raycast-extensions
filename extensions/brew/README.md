# Brew Extension for Raycast

Search and manage your brew casks and formulae from [Raycast](https://raycast.com).

## Homebrew 5.0 Compatibility

This extension is compatible with Homebrew 5.0 and later. Key changes in Homebrew 5.0:

- **Concurrent Downloads**: Homebrew 5.0 enables parallel downloads by default. If you experience issues, you can disable this in the extension preferences.
- **Internal API**: Homebrew 5.0 introduces a more efficient internal JSON API. You can opt-in to this experimental feature in preferences.
- **Deprecated Flags**: The `--no-quarantine` and `--quarantine` flags are deprecated in Homebrew 5.0.
- **macOS Support**: Homebrew 5.0 no longer supports macOS Mojave (10.14) and older.

For more details, see the [Homebrew 5.0 release notes](https://brew.sh/2025/11/12/homebrew-5.0.0/).

## Performance

This extension uses several optimizations to provide a fast experience:

- **Two-Phase Loading**: Installed packages load quickly with basic info, then fetch full metadata in the background.
- **Lazy Loading**: Package details are fetched on-demand when viewing, not upfront.
- **Internal API Option**: When enabled, downloads are 96% smaller (~1 MB vs ~30 MB for formulae).
