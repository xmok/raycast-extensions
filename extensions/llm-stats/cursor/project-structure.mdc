# Artificial Analysis for Raycast: Project Structure

## Description
This document outlines the file structure for the Artificial Analysis Raycast extension, organized by responsibility. It serves as a roadmap for development.

```

## Directory Descriptions

### `/src` - Commands
The root `src` directory contains all Raycast command files. Each command is self-contained and includes all its UI logic.
- `comparison-of-models.tsx`: Main command for comparing AI models.

### `/src/components/actions/` - Action Components
Reusable `Action`, `ActionPanel.Submenu` and `ActionPanel` components that encapsulate operations related for concrete features.
- etc.

### `/src/components/views/` - View Components
Reusable components that represent different views within a part of some command.
- etc.

Each view is a React component that is displayed in the Raycast window as a page.

### `/src/hooks/` - Custom React Hooks
Custom hooks for managing state and logic.

### `/src/utils/` - Utilities
Minimal, essential helper functions.

### `/src/types/` - TypeScript Definitions
Contains all TypeScript type definitions and interfaces for the extension that should be available across the all commands/actions/hooks/views.
- `index.ts`: Core types for the extension (related to extension-specific data models).

## Organizational Principles

- **Commands Own UI**: Command files (`/src/*.tsx`) contain all UI rendering logic. Views from `/src/components/views` are used to compose the final UI.
- **Reusable Actions**: Standardized `Action` components are in `/src/components/actions/` for use across different commands.
- **Minimal Utilities**: The `/src/utils/` directory contains only essential, reusable functions.
- **Native Raycast API**: Use Raycast APIs directly (e.g., `getPreferenceValues()`, `showToast()`) without creating wrappers.

## Dependencies

### Main
- `@raycast/api` & `@raycast/utils`
- `react`: For UI components.

### Development
- `typescript`
- `eslint` & `@raycast/eslint-config`
